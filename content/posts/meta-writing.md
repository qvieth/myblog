**DRAFT -> not finished, come back when i have time, tommorow maybe, put it here so my blog looks like it is not dead**

When I created this blog, I wanted it to be a stimulus for me to achieve a goal - "to write at least an hour a day". `make it clear why 1 hour a day` I belive writing would benefit me a lot with my growth: By writing, I can organize my thought; I can express my feelings better; and I would understand ideas at the deepest level.

Achieving that goal wasn't as straightforward as setting it. I thought by just reading enough on the topics, on writing itself and on the issue I want to mention, I can start to write as smooth as butter. But when I start puttting my hands on the keyboard, as I typing the words out, that really bad kind of anxiety crept in - the insecurity boy: I'm starting worrying about how my bad grammar will be discovered and judged, worrying about the issues that being discussed are "who cares!", and worrying that the vocabulary being used is boring, dull or awkward. And I told myself: "I can't write, at least for now; this is not the right time and the right mood; God, is this taking forever?". These thoughts have haunted me for years since i was a school boy til even now.

For that reason, I labeled myself as a bad writer. What's more, as a consequence, when it comes to actions that requires communications, I also labeled myself as a bad one. Because I don't practice. Because I avoid doing so.

And now, I'm writing these out, a writing about writing, as a way to revise the lessons I learned but haven't put into practice. I want this post to be a foundation where all my future posts will be built upon. `need a thesis statement here` [comeback later here](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/how-to-write-an-analytical-essay#how-to-write-an-analytical-essay-in-7-steps)

## Writing is a process

It was yesterday, I was stucking at my own computer doing the writing chore: typed the words out, then deleted those, then them typed out again... everything repeated. Until I just deleted them all, the entire file, decided take a break for a while. In the break, my mind started wandering: "Is it because the topic i'm choosing is hard to write (I was writing about perfectionism at the time), or is it because my thought is too messy to be organized into a simple essay", "maybe i analyze my own writing way","maybe all the approaches was wrong". I just realized by stop thinking at the topics i'm writing, stop asking what line to write next, this is quite counterintuitive, but for this time, really when i stop finding a way only then i know where to go.

Thank god i just look back reread my most favorite book on writing, a quote that used to impress me but somehow i forget appeared:

> "You will write more clearly when you more clearly understand what you are writing about" - Style, The Basics of Clarity and Grace - Joseph M. Williams

I did spent lot of time on the writing topic, not as much, if not insignificant on the perfectionism topic - the last topic i was trying to write about. So by change the topic to what i'm more confident, i begin to less worrry about the "clearly understand what you writing about" part.

I want to leave a small note on this book title of professor Joseph M. Williams: He described this book as *a book about writing based on your way of reading*, also many insights offered from this book are really unique. I would definitely recommend this book for my those who are struggling with writing chore, like me. I haven't fully grasph all the ideas of the book, but i'll leave it there and comeback everytime i stuggling on writing. I've just comeback and take one more quote:

> Whenever we reflect on what we do as we do it, we become self-conscious, sometimes to the point of paralysis. It passes. You can avoid some of that paralysis if you remember that these principles have little to do with how you draft much to do with how you revise. If there is a first principle of drafting, it’s to forget all advice about how to do it.

Thank for the quote, now i can continue my writing daringly. Enough promoting, although the offered insight is golden, I still feel like there's something missing, some final pieces for my writing formular: I just figured it out it is the window-pane and the scaffolding - this time i stole this idea from a course on writing for business by Dr. Quentin McAndrew. You can check this course out [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/writing-for-business). Again this is a course on business writing, so many of these principle i don't think they can work well with creative writing, if you are struggling with creative writing then i don't think this post is for you.

`this part(or the entire post idk) is quite dull, need a little bit revise`
and One more last piece I came up with while i was internalizing myself: It all start with thinking: by thinking, you can start generating ideas, by thinking, you should stop putting your hand on the computer - I mean I like computer but that distracts me a little bit sometimes. There's a lot of step in the word writing itself. So to mean writing is just writing — type out the word or write down on the paper — we're skipping a lot of others detail here. it's like telling that doing marketing is just doing sales.
Thinking should be seperated from anything else. Do things only once at a time, do not multitasking: let thinking have their own thread. So there it is, the first principle of the process: "seperate thinking from writing".


### First principle: Seperate thinking from writing

I know many writers write as they're thinking. So this is not true for these people, is it? 

`comeback next day`
- introduce

### Second principle: Windowpane

- clear as window pane
 
- look for two image of windowpane -> 1 on rainy day -> 1 are extremely clean
 
- writing is like a windowpane, so there it's is two kind of writing in this situation: the 1st window pane and the second windowpane
- your writing should be about your ideas, not about your writing - thank you Dr Quentin, this golden idea save me a lot with my insecurity about my writing. Now i can focus on that what's important
- ...

### Second principle: Scaffolding

- image of a scaffolding
- mention blankpage, how to overcome the fear of the blank page

#### 1. dealing with blankpage

#### 3. making with signpost

#### 4. completing with revising
