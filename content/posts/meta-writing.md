**DRAFT -> not finished, come back when i have time, tommorow maybe, put it here so my blog looks like it is not dead**

When I created this blog, I wanted it to be a stimulus for me to achieve a goal - "to write at least an hour a day". I belive writing would benefit me a lot with my growth: By writing, I can organize my thought, I can express my feelings better, and I would understand ideas at the deepest level.

Achieving that goal wasn't as straightforward as setting it. I thought by just reading enough on the topics, on writing itself and on the issue I want to mention, I can start to write, smoothly. But when I start puttting my hands on the keyboard, as I typing the words out, that really bad kind of anxiety crept in - the insecurity boy: I'm starting worrying about how my bad grammar will be discovered and judged, worrying about the issues that being discussed are "who cares!", and worrying that the vocabulary being used is boring, dull or awkward. Then I told myself: "I can't write, at least for now; this is not the right time and the right mood; God, is this taking forever?". These thoughts have haunted me for years since i was a school boy til even now.

So by writing this post, I really hope this curse will finally be cured as i finished the the work.

## Writing is a process

I was stucking at my own computer. Typed the words out, then deleted those, then them typed out again... everything repeated. Until I deleted the entire file, decided take a break for a while. And then I start wondering:"Is it because the topic i'm choosing is hard to write (I was writing about perfectionism at the time), or is it because my thought is too messy to be organized into a simple essay". So I think about a quote somehow appeared right at the time:

> "You will write more clearly when you more clearly understand what you are writing about" - Style, The Basics of Clarity and Grace - Joseph M. Williams

A small note on this — This book title of professor Joseph M. Williams is the my most favorite book title about writing. He described this book as *a book on writing based on your way of reading*, also many insights offered from this book are really unique. I would definitely recommend this title for my friends who are wanting to improve their writing. **Disclaimer**: I'm no specilist on this topics, this is just my gut feelings telling me this book would be good fit for those want love to write. On writing this line, another qutoe just pop out of my mind, i have to do a quick reread on the book to look for this:

> Whenever we reflect on what we do as we do it, we become self-conscious, sometimes to the point of paralysis. It passes. You can avoid some of that paralysis if you remember that these principles have little to do with how you draft much to do with how you revise. If there is a first principle of drafting, it’s to forget all advice about how to do it.

Enough doing marketing for the book, although the offered insight is a golden, I still feel like there's something missing, some final piece for my writing formula: It is the scaffolding - this time i stole this idea from a writing for business course by Dr. Quentin McAndrew. You can check out this course [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/writing-for-business).

It all start with thinking: by thinking, you can start generating ideas, by thinking, you should stop putting your hand on the computer - i mean i like computer but that distracts me a little bit sometimes. Thinking should be seperated from anything else. Do things only once at a time, do not multitasking and let thinking flow. So there it is, the first principle of the process: "seperate thinking from writing"

### First principle: Seperate thinking from writing

I know many writers write as they're thinking. So this is not true for these people, is it?

- introduce

### Second principle: Windowpane

- clear as window pane

### Second principle: Scaffolding

- introduce the scaffolding

#### 1. dealing with blankpage

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy eirmod tempor invidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliquyam erat, sed diam voluptua. At vero eos et accusam et justo duo dolores et ea rebum. Stet clita kasd gubergren, no sea takimata sanctus est Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

#### 2. starting with purpose

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy eirmod tempor invidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliquyam erat, sed diam voluptua. At vero eos et accusam et justo duo dolores et ea rebum. Stet clita kasd gubergren, no sea takimata sanctus est Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

#### 3. making with signpost

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy eirmod tempor invidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliquyam erat, sed diam voluptua. At vero eos et accusam et justo duo dolores et ea rebum. Stet clita kasd gubergren, no sea takimata sanctus est Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

#### 4. completing with revising

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy eirmod tempor invidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliquyam erat, sed diam voluptua. At vero eos et accusam et justo duo dolores et ea rebum. Stet clita kasd gubergren, no sea takimata sanctus est Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

## final thoughts

the framework

```
must seperate thinking from writing, only write after finished thinking
blankpage -> purpose -> signpost -> drafting -> revising
```

do not introduce more argument, simply reintroduce
