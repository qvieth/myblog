## discussion

- this study examines the correlation of **different types of motivation** defined in SDT and **job-related well-being**

### 4 interesting findings:

1. workaholism +> extrinsic motivation , workaholism +> identified regulation
2. work engagement +> intrinsic motivation
3. work engagement +> extrinsic motivation
4. burnout -> intrinsic motivation and autonomous extrinsic motivation, burnout +> introjected regulation for physician group only(not the nurse)

=> suggestion from author:
One explanation for the finding that only among physician group we find positive correlation between burnout and introject regulation is that:

- As physician vow to the Hippocratic Oath, is that physicians have a strong and internalised ethic of responsibility: they feel they must work (Wu, Zhu, Li, Wang, & Wang, 2008)
- As a result, physicians may feel they must work (i.e. work is a duty), whereas not working may induce negative feelings about oneself.
  => These findings support earlier findings that **need satisfaction** -> **emotional exhaustion**

Whereas burned-out physicians are primarily driven by introjected regulation, burned-out nurses are not driven by any of the motivational regulations in particular.
=> These findings contradict the assumption that burned-out employees’ behavior is motivated by both external and introjected regulation. Rather these findings suggest that nurses experiencing burnout are a-motivated.

- This strong internalised work ethic may encourage the development of burnout, which could explain why physicians are among the occupational groups with the highest levels of burnout (Schaufeli, 2007).
  => These findings support earlier findings that **need satisfaction** -> **emotional exhaustion**
- Whereas burned-out physicians are primarily driven by introjected regulation, burned-out nurses are not driven by any of the motivational regulations in particular
- These findings contradict the assumption that burned-out employees’ behavior is motivated by both external and introjected regulation
- rather the findings suggests that nurses experiencing burnout are amotivated.

```
point out amotivation from SDT: Amotivation manifests itself by acting without intent or refraining from any acting.
It is the consequence of not valuing an activity, not feeling competent to perform it, or not believing that it will lead to a desired outcome (Ryan & Deci, 2000a).
It seems plausible that burned-out employees are a-motivated because they distance themselves from their work to prevent further depletion of mental resources

## limitation

- One limitation of the present study is that all constructs were measured using self-reports
- Second, our data were collected among a relatively homogeneous sample of Chinese medical professionals
- Third, the present study used a cross-sectional design. the design did not allow the authors to examine the causal relations among these concepts

## theoretical and practical implications

The present study provide both theoretical and practical implications, also extends previous research in at least three ways.

### - theoretical implications:

1. First, theoretical implication: it is the first to uncover the motivational correlates of workaholism, work engagement, and burnout using SDT and to show that these correlates differ substantially and meaningfully.


    - Although workaholic employees are basically extrinsically motivated, engaged employees are both extrinsically and intrinsically motivated.

2. Second, the present study provides indirect evidence for SDT's assumption


    - that human beings are active, growth-oriented organisms and that fostering this tendency leads to optimal functioning and well-being, whereas thwarting it leads to adverse outcomes.

### - practical impliications:

3. Third, the present study provides directions for practical use. Since work engagement is linked to beneficial outcomes at the individual and organisational levels


    - The present study suggests that fostering autonomous motivation may simultaneously lead to an increase in work engagement and a decrease in workaholism and burnout.
    - One way to achieve this is by making jobs more attractive and challenging to employees, and adopting an autonomy-supportive management style that includes being emphatic, offering choices, and providing meaningful rationales for doing particular tasks

## conclusion comments

examined the **motivational correlates** of workaholism, work engagement, and burnout

Workaholic employees work hard because they are mainly driven or pushed by a strong need to prove themselves and because they personally value work outcomes,

while engaged employees work hard because they are mainly pulled by their inherently enjoyable and satisfying work.

Finally, employees experiencing burnout are neither pushed nor pulled to work; rather, they distance themselves from their work.

Although the associations among motivational regulation and job-related well-being are more complex than was anticipated, -> state out the anticipated
the present study demonstrated that workaholism, work engagement, and burnout are each associated with a prototypical underlying motivational regulation.
