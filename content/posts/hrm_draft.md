## discussion

### Findings:

- while examining the correlation of **different types of motivation** defined in SDT and **job-related well-being**, there are 4 interesting findings
  1. workaholism +> extrinsic motivation , workaholism +> identified regulation
  2. work engagement +> intrinsic motivation
  3. work engagement +> extrinsic motivation
  4. burnout -> intrinsic motivation and autonomous extrinsic motivation, burnout +> introjected regulation for physician group only(not the nurse)

---

=> suggestion from author: as finding number 4 affects physicians group only
=> might bebecause as physicians vow to Hippocratic Oath -> they feel they must work (Wu, Zhu, Li, Wang, & Wang, 2008)

---

=> These findings support earlier findings that **need satisfaction** -> **emotional exhaustion**

Whereas burned-out physicians are primarily driven by introjected regulation, burned-out nurses are not driven by any of the motivational regulations in particular.
=> These findings contradict the assumption that burned-out employeesâ€™ behavior is motivated by both external and introjected regulation.
Rather these findings suggest that nurses experiencing burnout are a-motivated.

## limitation

- One limitation of the present study is that all constructs were measured using self-reports
- Second, our data were collected among a relatively homogeneous sample of Chinese medical professionals
- Third, the present study used a cross-sectional design. the design did not allow the authors to examine the causal relations among these concepts

our suggestion:

1. self report inflated the associations among the study variables => field study
2. homogeneous sample of Chinese medical professionals. These professionals worked at only 4 different hospitals, same medium size city in china -> the correlation might be strongly affected by the cultural and working environment of these company, also the nature of the job position nurse and physician
3. cross-sectional design => longitudinal

## theoretical and practical implications

The present study provide both theoretical and practical implications

### - theoretical implications:

1. it is the first to uncover the motivational correlates of workaholism, work engagement, and burnout using SDT and to show that these correlates differ substantially and meaningfully.

   - Although workaholic employees are basically extrinsically motivated, engaged employees are both extrinsically and intrinsically motivated.

2. the present study provides indirect evidence for SDT's assumption

   - that human beings are active, growth-oriented organisms and that fostering this tendency leads to optimal functioning and well-being, whereas thwarting it leads to adverse outcomes.

### - practical impliications:

3. the present study provides directions for practical use. Since work engagement is linked to beneficial outcomes at the individual and organisational levels
   - The present study suggests that fostering autonomous motivation +> work engagement and -> in workaholism and burnout.

=> to achieve this:

- making jobs more attractive and challenging to employees,
- adopting an autonomy-supportive management style (being emphatic, offering choices, and providing meaningful rationales for doing particular tasks)

## conclusion comments

this study examined the **motivational correlates** of job-related well-being.

Workaholic vs work engagement vs burnout

correlations of motivational regulation and job-related well-being are more complex than was anticipated
the present study demonstrated job-related well-being are each associated with a prototypical underlying motivational regulation.
