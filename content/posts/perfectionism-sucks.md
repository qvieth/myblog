It is already two days since this blog was born. I know I should take more time reading and thinking and drafting and revising. But god! It would take forever for me to start the first post. Also, that insecurity and the little gremlin keep telling: "The first writing has to be perfect."

So I just decided to screw that insecurity and point my middle finger at the little bastard gremlin: "This is my first post, and it's not perfect!"

## A Request For Comments

Dear passerby, if you somehow find this site interesting enough for you to make it to this line, can you consider leaving a comment down below? Tell me anything: what do you expect from reading a book review post, or it would be awesome if you could suggest your favorite book for me to read so that later we can have a discussion or debate about the topics. I love feedback.

I'll make this post a portal through which you, my avid reader, can interact with me. Perhaps later, when I already have many high-quality posts, and you feel that I'm trustworthy enough to give you advice on your issue (as a friend, not a therapist, of course), you can come here and leave a question. For now, I just put it here.
