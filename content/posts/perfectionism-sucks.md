DRAFTING PHRASE, comeback later

It is already two days since this blog was born. I know I should take more time reading and thinking and drafting and revising. But god! It would take forever for me to finish my first post. Also, that insecurity and the little gremlin keep telling: "The first writing has to be perfect."

purpose: mention my self perfectionism which leads to insecurity, low self esteeem , and how i'm gonna go through it


i don't want my blog to be a place of perfectionist, right now i can see that if i keep this mentality, everypost has to be perfect, you have to be a best writer first to be a blogger, then i could never achieve that goal, to create my own blog. right now along the way, this blog will have many shitty post, but i'll get along the way. also that's why feedback from you, would be really important to me, i don't want to be good, i want to be better, everyday

Right now i'm still stucking on the planning phrase, so I just decided to screw that insecurity and point my middle finger at the little bastard devil: "This is my first post, and it's not perfect!"

## perfectionism 

This post main goal is to break the bad my old bad habit: 
this is not the first version
easy me cognitive loads on things that already gone, this post, it's like have revise it like lots of times
nihilism by knowing that nothing really matters, everybody's gonna die someday, i feel less insecure about myself
be realistic, honest
not analyze myself over gramamr and commas
imperfection, messy, because it's real
i don't wanna show that's i'm not anxiety
ideal
things i created never good enough
high standard can be good, can push you
maladaptive
painful, pointless and waste of time, nothing you can never achieve
vs authenticity : i'm bad but i'll
genuine beneficial as possible
i'm human axious
 where do we draw the line between wanting to do our best and chasing perfection?
 being ourselves and becoming who we want to be? 
 caring too much about fake things and appearences is very unhealthy, which is something most people on youtube and social media don't seem to realise...
 in some sort of ways, i don't really want to abandon the perfectionism, because in a way, it's really inspiration
by abandon perfectionism, i don't want to have another problem, to have an excuse for the post to be shitty, -> must be a standard, a principle

## A Request For Comments

Dear passerby, if you somehow find this site interesting enough for you to make it to this line, can you consider leaving a comment down below? Tell me anything: what do you expect from reading a book review post, or it would be awesome if you could suggest your favorite book for me to read so that later we can have a discussion or debate about the topics. I love feedback.

I'll make this post a portal through which you, my avid reader, can interact with me. Perhaps later, when I already have many high-quality posts, and you feel that I'm trustworthy enough to give you advice on your issue (as a friend, not a therapist, of course), you can come here and leave a question. For now, I just put it here.
