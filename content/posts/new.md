By the time finishing developing the website, I was really happy thinking I can start with my writing stuff and introduce myself to the world. Just until a recent moment, after half a day of researching and thinking, I came up with a conclusion: I should spend more time on reading books and others' blogs..., before I finally come up with an official, formal introduction.

## A Request For Comments

Dear passerby, by somehow, if you do pity me for my frustration, please consider helping this depressed author by leaving a suggestion comment: telling about what you would expect to know, or about the author, what you consider interesting, or anything you would like to share(like perhaps why you are here in the first place...)

If you already got bored at reading this blog but somehow still made it to this line, I suggest you spend your precious reading time on these blogs which were my main inspirations for starting this site:

- [Chip Huyen](https://huyenchip.com/)
- [amateurpsychology](https://amateurpsychologyt.wixsite.com/website)
- [thepresentwriter](https://thepresentwriter.com/blog/)
