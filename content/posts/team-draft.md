# Gendered Styles of Verbal Communication

In addition to expressing cultural views of gender, language is a primary means by which we
express our gendered identities. In the pages that follow, we’ll explore the ways we use ­verbal
communication to perform masculinity and femininity. Keep in mind that we’re l ­ ooking at
gendered styles of communicating, not necessarily sex-based styles. In other words, although
most girls are socialized to communicate primarily in feminine ways, some girls learn
­masculine modes of communicating; although most boys are encouraged to cultivate primar-
ily masculine styles of communicating, some boys learn feminine modes. Also, some people
work to become fluent in both masculine and feminine modes of communication, and some
people perform identities that are beyond the conventional gender binary.

## Gendered Communication Practices

We will consider features of feminine and masculine speech that have been identified by
researchers. We’ll also explore some of the complications that arise when people of different
genders operate by different rules in conversations with each other.
topics introduction

### Feminine Communication

People who are socialized in feminine speech communities—most women and some men—tend to regard communication as a ­**primary**
way to establish and maintain relationships with others. They use language to foster
­connections and support closeness and mutual understanding (Ye & Palomares, 2013).

Establishing equality between people is a **second** important feature of feminine
­communication. To achieve symmetry, communicators often match experiences to i ­ ndicate
“You’re not alone in how you feel.” Typical ways to communicate equality would be ­saying
“I’ve felt just like that” or “I totally know what you mean.” Growing out of the quest for
­equality is a participatory mode of interacting in which communicators respond to and build
on each other’s ideas in the process of conversing. Rather than a rigid “You tell your ideas,
then I’ll tell mine” sequence, feminine speech more characteristically follows an interactive
pattern for the collaborative creation of conversation.

A **third** characteristic of feminine speech is support for others. To demonstrate support,
communicators often express emotions (Guerrero, Jones, & Boburka, 2006; Mulac, 2006; Ye &
Palomares, 2013) to show understanding of another’s situation or feelings. “Oh, you must
feel terrible” communicates that we understand and support how another feels. Related to
these first two features is attention to the relationship level of communication (Eisenberg,
2002; MacGeorge, Gillihan, Samter, & Clark, 2003). You will recall that the relationship level
of talk focuses on feelings and on the relationship between communicators rather than on
the content of messages. Conversations between feminine people tend to be characterized by
intensive adverbs (“That’s really exciting”) (Mulac, 2006) and questions that probe for greater
understanding of feelings and perceptions surrounding the subject of talk. “How did you feel
when it occurred?” “How does this fit into the overall relationship?” are probes that help a
listener understand a speaker’s perspective.

A **fourth** feature of feminine speech style is conversational “maintenance work” ( ­ Fishman,
1978; Taylor, 2002). This involves efforts to sustain conversation by inviting others to speak
and by prompting them to elaborate their ideas. Questions are often used to include ­others:
“How was your day?” “Did anything interesting happen on your trip?” “Do you have a ­ nything
to add?” (Mulac, 2006). Communication of this sort maintains interaction and opens the
conversational door to others.

A **fifth** quality of feminine speech is responsiveness. A feminine person might make eye
contact, nod, or say, “Tell me more” or “That’s interesting.” Responsiveness affirms the other
person and encourages elaboration by showing interest in what was said.

A **sixth** quality of feminine talk is personal, concrete style. Typical of feminine talk are
details, personal disclosures, and concrete reasoning. These features cultivate a personal tone,
and they facilitate feelings of closeness by connecting communicators’ lives.

A **final** feature of feminine speech is tentativeness (Mulac, 2006; Ye & Palomares, 2013).
This may be expressed in a number of forms. Sometimes people use verbal hedges, such as
“I kind of feel you may be overreacting.” In other situations, they qualify statements by saying
“I’m not sure if this is right, but….” Another way to keep talk provisional is to tag a question
onto a statement in a way that invites another to respond: “Scandal is a pretty good show, isn’t
it?” Tentative communication opens the door for others to respond and express their opinions.

There is controversy about tentativeness associated with feminine speech. Robin Lakoff
(1975), who first reported that women use more hedges, qualifiers, and tag questions than
men, claimed that these indicate uncertainty and lack of confidence. Calling women’s
speech “powerless,” Lakoff argued that it reflects women’s insecurity. It’s important to note
that Lakoff ’s judgment that feminine speech is powerless was based on her assumption
that ­masculine speech is the standard. If we use feminine speech as the standard, the use
of hedges, qualifiers, and tag questions may reflect not powerlessness but the desire to keep
conversations open and to include others. You should realize, however, that people outside
feminine speech communities—for example, in professional settings—may use masculine
standards, as Lakoff did, to interpret tentative speech.

### Masculine Communication

Masculine speech communities tend to regard talk as a
way to accomplish concrete goals, exert control, preserve independence, entertain, and enhance
status. Conversation is often seen as an arena for proving oneself and negotiating prestige.

The **first** feature of masculine speech is the effort to establish status and control. M
­ asculine
speakers do this by asserting their ideas and authority, telling jokes and stories, or challenging
others. Also, men maintain both control and independence by disclosing less than women.
Men and boys typically use more I-references (“I have a plan,” “I had a good game”) than
women and girls (Mulac, 2006). One way to exhibit knowledge and control is to give advice.
For example, a person might say, “The way you should handle that is …,” or “Don’t let your
boss get to you.” On the relationship level of meaning, people socialized in feminine speech
communities may interpret advice as the speaker saying she or he is superior—smarter, more
experienced, and so on—in comparison to the other person.

A **second** prominent feature of masculine speech is instrumentality—the use of face-to-face or
­ bjectives ­(Kimbrough,
computer-mediated communication (CMC) to accomplish instrumental o
Guadagno, Muscanell, & Dill, 2013). Particularly when men think they are knowledgeable about
a topic, they may want to show their knowledge to others (Leaper & Ayres, 2007). In conversa-
tion, this is often expressed through problem-solving efforts to get information, discover facts,
and suggest solutions. Conversations between feminine and ­masculine communicators are often
derailed by the lack of agreement on the meaning of this informational, instrumental focus.
When a man focuses on the content level of meaning after a woman has disclosed a problem, she
may feel that he is disregarding her emotions. He, on the other hand, thinks he is supporting her
in the way that he has learned to show support—suggesting how to solve the problem.

A **third** feature of masculine communication is conversational command. Despite jokes
about women’s talkativeness, research indicates that, in most contexts, men tend to talk more
often and at greater length than women (Mulac, 2006). Further, masculine speakers may
reroute conversations by using what another says as a jumping-off point for their own topics,
or they may interrupt. Although all genders interrupt, most research suggests that men do it
more frequently (Farley, Ashcraft, Stasson, & Nusbaum, 2010; West & Zimmerman, 1983).

Not only do men generally interrupt more than women, they may do so for different
reasons. Research indicates that men are more likely to interrupt to control conversation by
challenging other speakers or wresting the talk stage from them, whereas women i ­ nterrupt
to indicate interest and respond to others. A different explanation is that men generally
interrupt more than women because interruptions are considered normal and good-natured
within the norms of masculine speech communities. Whereas interruptions that reroute
­conversation might be viewed as impolite and intrusive in feminine speech communities, the
outgoing, give-and-take character of masculine speech may render interruptions just part of
normal conversation.

**Fourth**, masculine speech tends to be direct and assertive. Compared with women’s
­language, men’s language is typically more forceful and authoritative (Mulac, 2006). An
exception to this pattern is when men talk with someone of high status. In this situation, men
with lower status may be less assertive and commanding (O’Neill & Colley, 2006; Palomares,
2008, 2010).

**Fifth**, masculine speech tends to be more abstract than feminine speech. Men f ­ requently
speak in general or conceptual terms that are removed from concrete experiences and p
­ ersonal
feelings. Within public environments, norms for speaking call for theoretical, ­conceptual,
and general thought and communication. Yet, within more personal ­relationships, abstract
talk sometimes creates barriers to intimacy.

**Finally**, masculine speech tends to be less emotionally responsive than feminine speech,
especially on the relationship level of meaning (Guerrero et al., 2006). Men, more than
women, give what are called minimal response cues (Parlee, 1979), which are verbaliza-
tions such as “yeah” or “um hmm.” Studies suggest that this verbal communication pattern
is reflected in CMC as well, with men using fewer references to emotions in email than do
women (Ye & Palomares, 2013). People socialized into feminine speech communities may
perceive minimal response cues as indicating lack of involvement (Fishman, 1978). Men’s
conversation also often lacks self-disclosure as well as expressed sympathy and understanding
(Eisenberg, 2002), although men report feeling more comfortable with higher levels of dis-
closure to romantic partners when communicating via CMC (Walton & Rice, 2013). Within
the rules of masculine speech communities, sympathy is a sign of condescension, and the
revealing of personal problems is seen as making one vulnerable. Yet, within feminine speech

communities, sympathy and disclosure are understood as demonstrations of ­equality and
support. This creates potential for misunderstanding between people who express ­themselves
in different ways.

As you many have noticed, gendered patterns in online communication often reflect
­gendered speech communities. Research indicates that men and women tend to differ in
their motivation and use of the Internet, with men emphasizing instrumentality and task
completion and women emphasizing connectivity to others. While men were quicker to
adopt computer technologies, women now use digital technologies more than do men due to
the rise in social media networks (Kimbrough et al., 2013).
