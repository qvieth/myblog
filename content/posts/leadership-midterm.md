# My Answer:

## A. Learning to be aware of yourself isn’t always easy, but practicing this skill can help you become a true leader.

while answering the number 1 question about strengths, I tried different labels for my strengths like perseverance, fast-learner, or creative but it just doesn't really fit. i think to desribe any strength i have to use a spectrum, like perseverance 70% chance in all situation, fast learning 60%, and creative 50%. looking at my strength that way is quite subjective as the value between 0 and 100 is quite feeling based for me to come up with. Therefore I try a different approach of how i look at myself

i'll look at what i value the most in my life,my core value, because what i value have a significant effect on what i believe, and therefore it guides my future behaviors. answer the question this way, i think it is a more objective approach of looking at myself. similar to the first question, other questions will be answered using core value i developed here.

3 things i value the most are knowledge, change, and society.

In the past, there were moments i feel negative or just have no idea what the future will be. Thanks to some random chance, knowledge that matter appeared and change the way i look at the problem. In a general way, that is how i value knowledge. As a result of that believe, i'm always seeking for knowledge. I want to change my status quos. I can't just rely on random chance to solve my problem; i have to actively seeking for the right knowledge pieces for solving the problem puzzle. Reading is a my number one way of absorbing knowledge.

My experience tell me that, knowledge is not constant, it's not always true or all the time true. i must keep an open mind. This is what i called change, i don't to stick to a belief rigidly. i don't want to trust my common sense. wasn't that how people believed "the earth is flat an sun orbits around the earth"? From that i know science is my religious. My belief always changes.

One more thing that i just recently value: society. from the young age, i was considered a shy kids. my teachers would see me as a math boy but never a literature boy. also there's a stereotype at the time that said boy are good at math while girl are good at liture. It was BS but i was young and i believed that "truth". I labeled myself as a bad literature student. And you may know the result, i afraid of literature. What happen to a kid when they not good at literature? I was bad at communicating and expressing myself. i always feel disconnected. this seems like an excuse for my social insecurity but i think this is the best way and somehow it reflect on my socialphobia. growing up, i worked hard believing i could do anything. i was half-right. On my journey of absorbing knowledge, i realize i could do anything but not everything. After all, i have to connect to people and work together. my nubmer 1 knowlege that i prioritize improving these days is emotional intelligence. according to daniel goleman, it has 5 basic areas of growth: self-awareness, managing emotions, self motivation, empathy and handling relationship; these areas are my current subject of studying.


### 1. What are your strengths and gifts that create the most value?
my strength is what i value, because that's what i believe i should improve: seeking for knowledge, an open mind and a social intelligence(i'm still a shy boy and it's hard for me to connect to people or speak publicly though; it is just i am looking into and trying to improve it a lot in the recent time). 


### 2. What are your vulnerabilities or development challenges?
Being shy, so shy that i still remember my first presentation when i was in secondary school, i was in a english presenting contest and the subject is about one's own family. the experience was frighten that i was standing there like a stone. you may have guessed the result. my second presentation is in my fresh man year, in the english class. same result as the secondary year. It was bad also. i think the development challenge for me is to be working with people.


### 3. What would your dearest, most trusted friend or classmate say are your greatest strengths and your greatest weaknesses?

### 4. What insights have your self-reflections reminded you of your strengths, gifts, and vulnerabilities?
The biggest insight is that i was priviledged. i was lucky for being born in where i was. not everyone can have the same priviledge as i had. Social location is important for a child development. social is important. everyone are the ways they are because of so many factors and i have to respect that. if i ever judge a person or what they think, i must look in their perspective. i love to understand people

### 5. What have the traumas and privileges of your life taught you?
Verbally abused is a my number 1 trauma. it taught me words should be spoken carefully with thought. emotion are also contagious. i have to improve my emotional intenlligence. empathy is my a gifts from that trauma as i know what it feels to feels not good. doing good things for people and care about their emotion is my another value.

### 6. Where do these strengths come from? Who has influenced you the most? What situations have influenced you the most?
these strenghts come from my family, my social location, and some random chance. i appreciate my dad for his work ethics and my mom for her love towards her children. i feel lucky for being born in the when and where i was born, so that i have good friends, places and experiences that form who i am. Wasn't all of those just merely random chance? i could be anywhere anyone but not myself of today. I just feel privileged for everything. I was telling you these because i couldn't look at life this way before i had a near death experience. being alive again tell me i have to live a meaningful life.

### 7. Recall the key peaks and valleys of your life. What have you learned from them?
when i was in the freshman year, my team and i have taken 1st place in a business competition. i thought it was the peaks of life, i thought i was smart, a gifted kid. just until the valley of my life, the near death experience, that i learned i was agrrogrant and every actions have it consequences, for every evaluation there is opportunity cost so choose wisely. turns out that valley is the true peak at which i found the purpose of my life.

### 8. Do people trust you? If they do, why? If they don’t, why not?

my mom and dad always trust me, they gave me what i call self-belief. thanks to them i now always believe in myself. believe i could change the world with work ethic and love.

there are people believing in me, also there are not. But i know the first condition for others to believe in me is that i have to believe in myself first. I have a purpose, a drive. also i have an idea of what to learn to make people believe in me. being reliable, being honest, and being socially intelligent are what i aiming to become.
